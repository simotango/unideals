# Quick Commands to Push to GitHub

After creating your repository on GitHub, run these commands:

## Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username

```bash
# Add GitHub remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/unideals-backend.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Example (if your username is "johnsmith"):

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/johnsmith/unideals-backend.git
git push -u origin main
```

## After pushing, your public URL will be:

```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/unideals-backend
```
